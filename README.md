# PGSBench
Benchmarking of Psychiatric PGS (traditional approach as well as more novel approach: GSEM) across diverse ancestry groups in twocohorts

# Workflow
## Step 1: Pre-process data
### PNC 
1. Predictors: PGSs of psychiatric traits and PGS of latent traits (Externalizing Consortium; Irwin GSEM; my GSEM)

2. Outcomes: Factor score of latent factors; diagnoses of 15 disorders (or symptom score?)
### ABCD
1. Predictors: PGSs of psychiatric traits and PGS of latent traits (Externalizing Consortium; Irwin GSEM; my GSEM)

2. Outcomes: Factor score of latent factors; KSADS of disorders with >X% of prevalence (need to figure out what the X is); CBCL syndrome scale?
