# Project Description
Benchmarking of Psychiatric PGS (traditional approach as well as GSEM) across diverse ancestry groups in two cohorts (PNC and ABCD)
Goal of the project: 
## To do for now: 
1. I already have scripts from previous analyses as well as plots, results, etc. Put all of them into an Archive file, mark date, maybe write a short summary of the general approach, and then start project all over, revising previous scripts, but updating with more clear organization/workflow, and using new factor scores, etc. 
2. Use the previous PGSs (clumped using 1kg is probably fine), but spend some time to look over the GWASs, and prepare summary tables for all GWASs, including the GSEM. Need to be very clear about what GWAS each PGS was calculated from. Add publication link to GWASs.
3. Review my GSEM model. Prepare results as if it's a separate project for publication. prepare method summary, organize scripts (pull from SSCC?), prepare results. Archive old results properly (some models e.g., the bifactor S-1 model, might be useful in the future, so don't dumpt all archived results in one folder without documentation/explanation. )
4. Clarify goals and significance of project. 
5. Decide whether to use Irwin GSEM or my GSEM. Maybe just use Irwin's version because it is published??

# Workflow
## Step 1: Pre-process data
### PNC 
1. Data
  
Predictors: PGSs of psychiatric traits and PGS of latent traits (Externalizing Consortium; Irwin GSEM; my GSEM)
  
Outcomes: Factor score of latent factors; diagnoses of 15 disorders (or symptom score?)
2. Preprocess: 

### ABCD
1. Data

Predictors: PGSs of psychiatric traits and PGS of latent traits (Externalizing Consortium; Irwin GSEM; my GSEM)

Outcomes: Factor score of latent factors; KSADS of disorders with >X% of prevalence (need to figure out what the X is); CBCL syndrome scale?

2. Preprocess
